This project was introduced at university and the definition that was given to us as a group was the creation of a Cryptocurrency Platform Simulator. In this group project, I was responsible for the entire implementation. This is a web-based cryptocurrency platform programmed using React with the classic web development including bootstrap using a NOSQL database called Firebase.
## Key Operations
## Trader & Premium Trader
### Buy and Sell Cryptocurrency
As this was a simulator demo, I had created 3 cryptocurrencies that randomly varied in price and the user would be able to them purchase or sell their amount of cryptocurrency. This then allows them to have funds in their designated wallet.
### Transfer Cryptocurrency
Traders are able to transfer cryptocurrency between other traders.
### Upgrade to Premium
Traders are able to upgrade to a higher tier where they get help from analysts by using the inbuilt communication platform so they are able to make informed and targeted purchase and selling decisions.
### Access to Wallet and import/export bought Cryptocurrencies 
Traders have access to their wallets for each cryptocurrency and they are able to import and export the wallet onto their internet enabled device.
